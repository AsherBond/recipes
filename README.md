Eucalyptus Recipes Project
==========================

The purpose of the Eucalyptus Recipes Project is to make it dead-easy to make Eucalyptus instances that are exactly how you want them, with a bunch of pre-baked recipes to help you get started.

In the bootstrap folder, you will find the basic metadata scripts that serve as the example for all recipes.  Run euca-run-instances with the -f switch, and your recipe will run as soon as the instance starts.

Current bootstraps include setup for puppet and chef clients.  Many more examples will be coming soon!
